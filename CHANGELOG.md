---

## [2026-07-09] — VirusTotal Integration

### Added — VirusTotal URL reputation lookup
- New **🦠 VirusTotal** row in the Live Threat Intelligence panel queries 70+ antivirus and threat intelligence engines for a consensus verdict on any scanned URL
- Verdict thresholds: 3+ engines flagging → **MALICIOUS** · 1–2 engines or 3+ suspicious → **SUSPICIOUS** · else → **CLEAN**
- Results show malicious / suspicious / clean engine counts with a direct link to the full VirusTotal report
- If the URL has never been submitted to VirusTotal, shows **NOT SCANNED** with a link to submit it

### Added — VirusTotal proxy endpoint in server.js
- New `GET /api/virustotal/url?url=...` endpoint proxies requests to the VirusTotal v3 API, bypassing browser CORS restrictions
- Accepts the API key from the `x-vt-key` request header (sent by the browser) or falls back to `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in `.env`
- When running standalone (no server), shows **BLOCKED** with a manual VirusTotal link as fallback

### Added — VirusTotal API key field
- New **VirusTotal API Key** input in the ⚙️ Live API Keys panel, saved and restored from localStorage
- Free key available at virustotal.com — no rate limit for individual lookups on the free tier
- Added `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` to `.env.example` as an optional server-side alternative

## [2026-07-09] — Expanded URL Detection Engine

### Added — Global brand impersonation detection
- New `URL_BRAND_SPOOF` pattern list detects typosquatting and lookalike domains for 19 major brands regardless of active sector: PayPal, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, IRS, DocuSign, DHL, FedEx, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Zoom, Stripe, Venmo, Coinbase
- Fires +45 risk and `credential` trigger — results show which brand is being impersonated

### Added — @ symbol URL deception detection
- Detects `https://google.com@evil.com` style URLs where browsers ignore everything before `@` and load `evil.com`
- Fires +40 risk and `credential` trigger

### Added — Punycode / homograph attack detection
- Detects `xn--` in the domain — internationalized lookalike domains (e.g. аpple.com with Cyrillic characters) that appear identical to real brands
- Fires +35 risk and `credential` trigger

### Added — Open redirect parameter detection
- Detects `?redirect=`, `?url=`, `?next=`, `?goto=`, `?return=`, `?redir=`, `?target=`, `?callback=`, `?dest=`, `?destination=` in query string
- Fires +20 risk and `transmission` trigger

### Added — Hyphen abuse detection
- Domains with 3+ hyphens (e.g. `secure-paypal-update-account.com`) flagged as suspicious
- Fires +15 risk

### Added — Percent-encoding obfuscation detection
- Detects `%`-encoded characters in the URL path used to hide keywords from security scanners
- Fires +15 risk

### Updated — Path keyword list expanded
- Added: `signin`, `sign-in`, `wallet`, `billing`, `invoice`, `payment`, `checkout`, `webscr`, `banking`, `validate`, `suspend`, `unlock`, `restricted`

### Updated — High-risk TLD list expanded
- Added 14 TLDs: `.icu`, `.vip`, `.cc`, `.bz`, `.ws`, `.zip`, `.mov`, `.buzz`, `.monster`, `.cyou`, `.fit`, `.bar`, `.cfd`, `.sbs`
- Total now 27 monitored TLDs (was 13)

---

## [2026-07-09] — Email Form Clear Button

### Added — Clear button on Email Phishing Analyzer
- New **✕ Clear** button next to the Analyze Email button clears all four input fields (Sender, Reply-To, Subject, Body) and resets the results panel to its empty state
- Does not affect Dashboard stats, scan history, compliance triggers, or any persisted localStorage state

---

## [2026-07-09] — Dashboard Persistence & Dynamic Compliance (v3.2)

### Added — Dashboard localStorage Persistence
- Dashboard state (scan counts, sector tallies, threat log, scan history) now survives page reloads via `localStorage`
- `saveState()` serializes all counters and history after every scan; `loadState()` restores them on startup
- State is keyed to `pgp_dashboard_state`; up to 50 email/URL history entries and 20 scan log entries are persisted
- **Last saved timestamp** displayed on the Dashboard card so users know when state was last written
- **🗑 Clear History** button wipes all persisted state and resets counters to zero (with confirmation prompt)

### Added — Recent Scan Activity card
- Dashboard card renamed from "Top Threat Indicators Detected" to **Recent Scan Activity**
- Previously only showed CRITICAL findings — now logs every scan regardless of severity (SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, PHISHING)
- Each entry shows scan type (email/URL), verdict badge, sender/URL truncated, sector, risk score, and time
- `scanLog` (up to 20 entries) is persisted in localStorage alongside the rest of the dashboard state

### Added — Dynamic Compliance Framework (Session Triggers)
- Compliance controls in the **📋 Compliance Framework** tab now show a live **TRIGGERED** status (amber highlight) when scan findings from the current session match the control's threat category
- Each sector maintains a `sessionTriggers` map keyed by threat type (`credential`, `awareness`, `transmission`, `bec`, `malware`, `incident`, `data`)
- `recordTrigger(key)` is called during email and URL analysis to mark which controls are relevant to real findings
- `renderCompliancePanel()` reads `sessionTriggers` to apply the `.cs-triggered` class and "TRIGGERED" label
- Trigger mapping covers 14 Gmail finding categories (Suspicious Sender Domain, Reply-To Mismatch, BEC indicators, Credential Harvesting, High-Risk Attachments, etc.)
- Session trigger state persists across reloads alongside the rest of the dashboard state

### Fixed — Browser cache serving stale JavaScript
- Added `Cache-Control: no-store` response header for all `.html` files in `server.js` static file middleware
- Prevents browsers from caching old versions of `index.html` after deployments; ensures users always run the latest JavaScript

## [2026-07-01] — AI Classification

### Added — AI URL Classification (Claude / Anthropic)
- New **🤖 AI Classification** source in the Live Threat Intelligence panel
- After scanning any URL, sends the URL structure (protocol, host, TLD, path) to Claude Haiku 4.5 via the Anthropic API for AI-powered phishing/malicious risk classification
- Returns a verdict of **MALICIOUS**, **SUSPICIOUS**, or **SAFE** with a one-sentence reason and confidence level (high / medium / low)
- Requires a personal Anthropic API key — enter it in the **⚙️ Live API Keys** panel (stored in browser localStorage only, never logged or shared)
- Shows **KEY REQUIRED** prompt with link to `console.anthropic.com` if no key is set

### Added — Anthropic Key Field in API Config Panel

## [2026-06-30] — Live Intelligence & Theme

### Added — Live Threat Intelligence Panel
- New **🌐 Live Threat Intelligence** card in the URL / Web Traffic Checker tab
- After analyzing any URL, automatically queries three external threat databases:
  - **URLScan.io** — searches existing scans for the domain (no API key needed). If browser CORS blocks the call, shows a clickable **Search URLScan.io manually ↗** link as fallback
  - **PhishTank** — checks if the URL is in the phishing database (free key required at phishtank.com)
  - **AbuseIPDB** — checks raw IP addresses for abuse reports (free key required at abuseipdb.com). Shows N/A for domain-based URLs

### Added — API Key Config Panel
- Collapsible **⚙️ Live API Keys** section inside the URL input card
- Paste PhishTank and AbuseIPDB keys directly on the site — no source code editing needed
- Keys are saved in browser localStorage and never sent anywhere except the respective API
